Based on the insights above here are some recommendations:

1.Promote Weekend Specials: Since orders are highest on weekends, consider offering special deals or promotions during these days to attract more customers and increase sales further.

2.Marketing Focus on Fridays: Given that Fridays have the highest orders, allocate marketing efforts towards promoting Friday specials or discounts to capitalize on this peak day.

3.Seasonal Promotions: Take advantage of the high sales in July by running seasonal promotions or themed menus tailored to summer preferences. Similarly, explore opportunities to boost sales during slower months like October by offering incentives or limited-time offers.

4.Menu Optimization: Since the Classic category contributes significantly to sales, consider expanding the menu within this category or highlighting popular classic pizzas to drive more sales. Additionally, evaluate the performance of less popular items like the Brie Carre Pizza and consider replacing or repositioning them on the menu.

5.Upselling and Cross-selling: Encourage customers to add more items to their orders by implementing upselling and cross-selling strategies. For example, offer combo deals or suggest complementary items like beverages or desserts to increase the average order value.

6.Customer Loyalty Programs: Implement a customer loyalty program to reward repeat customers and encourage them to order more frequently. Offer incentives such as discounts, freebies, or exclusive deals to incentivize loyalty and increase customer retention.

7.Enhance Online Ordering Experience: Streamline the online ordering process and ensure a seamless user experience across all devices. Consider implementing features like saved orders, quick reorder options, and personalized recommendations to make ordering more convenient and enticing for customers.

By implementing these recommendations, you can optimize sales, increase customer satisfaction, and drive overall growth in your pizza business.
